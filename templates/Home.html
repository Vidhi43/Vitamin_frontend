        <p class="fade-in">The Vitamin Deficiency Detection using Image Processing project was developed to address the growing global health issue of vitamin deficiency, which is linked to severe diseases such as cancer. Early detection plays a crucial role in effective treatment; however, current methods are often expensive, invasive, and require skilled professionals. Additionally, existing solutions lack precision, accessibility, and scalability, making them impractical for widespread use. To overcome these challenges, this project leverages deep learning and image classification techniques to analyze facial, skin, eye, and nail images for visible symptoms of vitamin deficiency.</p>
